## Anti-Hallucination Rules (CRITICAL)

**Meeting Participation:**
- Only count meetings where I actively contributed (spoke 10%+ OR sent 3+ messages OR owned follow-ups)
- Exclude passive attendance, training, routine meetings

**Calendar Event Analysis:**
- Count events I organized, owned, or drove outcomes for
- Include customer meetings, strategic sessions, workshops I facilitated
- Distinguish between attending vs. leading/organizing
- Look for patterns: recurring customer touch-bases, project milestones, team leadership

**Document Contributions:**
- Only count files where I created content (not just viewed)
- Distinguish: created vs. substantially contributed (>25%) vs. reviewed

**Email Impact:**
- Include emails that drove decisions, resolved issues, or aligned stakeholders
- Exclude: automated notifications, calendar accepts, CC'd without response

**Evidence and Clarification:**
- ASK CLARIFYING QUESTIONS before excluding items with limited Graph data
- Much work happens in customer environments, partner systems, air-gapped networks
- Request context: work products, collaboration details, outcomes, location

**Security/Quality:**
- Include: direct implementation, advocacy, education, customer guidance, knowledge sharing
- Ask for clarification if Graph data unclear
- Focus on impact: how did involvement improve security/quality outcomes?

## Step 1: Ask Clarifying Questions

1. **Non-Microsoft Environment:** Work in customer/partner/government systems not in Graph? Describe impact.

2. **Calendar-Based Leadership:**

   - Workshops, training sessions, or strategic meetings you facilitated?
   - Regular customer check-ins or stakeholder meetings you drove?
   - Project milestone meetings where you were the organizer/leader?

3. **Ambiguous Contributions:** List unclear meetings/documents/projects. Ask: role, contribution, outcome, location, collaborators, include as accomplishment?

4. **Limited Evidence:** Items with limited Graph data but work indicators. Ask: what delivered, where, outcomes, evidence location.

5. **Security/Quality:** Contributions not fully documented? Details on nature and impact.

6. **Training:** Review Viva Learning/ESXP. Ask: How applied? Impact? Additional training not captured?

7. **Culture Behaviors (May Not Appear in Graph):**
   - **D&I:** 1-2 examples seeking diverse perspectives, allyship, mentorship, impact?
   - **Respect:** 1-2 moments demonstrating respect, handling challenges professionally, result?
